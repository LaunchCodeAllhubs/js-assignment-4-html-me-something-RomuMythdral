         <h1>Building Computers</h1>
         <p>"I've spent the last 16 years being very facisnated
            over the hardware side of computers. I have leared what part 
            does what and how it all functions and opperates.
            At one point when I was around 13, I ended comparing all the parts
            of a computer to parts of the human body to help refernce it 
            eaesier for myself but for others too that wanted to learn."</p>

            <p>
               "I've played paintball for over a decade now. I've never played competetively but am now 
               starting to get into that realm of the sport. What makes me love it most is the fact of how fast paced it is
               and the fact that it incorperates so many slides and dives to get to cover. It's a very intense mind and body game.
               Lots of communication required. The best thing about the sport thats changed over the years in my opinion is the design of
               the paintball markers."

            "Over the recent years, I've delved deep into the Fighting game scene. (games such as Street Fighter, Tekken, Mortal Kombat, etc.)
            I have started even participating in tournaments with one of my best friends which has been a very surreal experence cause I've been able
            to meet some really cool and well known individuals within the scene."

         <h1>Singing and Dancing Competetively</h1>
         <p>"When I was in middle school and high school, I was part of concert choir and show choir. Our group consisted of 60 individual students
            where we all learned our vocal parts and choreography together. After we would feel fine tuned with our set, we would travel the world competing
            against other groups around the same age group."</p>
